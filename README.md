WP Alderaan
========
Just another starter theme for WordPress development
--------
#### This theme is a pretty barebones theme based on a few suggestions
*   Uses Foundation Framework
*   Uses Grunt for project scaffold, build and deploy
*   Uses Bower to pull in components
    * jQuery
    * Modernizr
    * Flexslider

We also suggest using our WordPress core starter, [Topcoat](https://github.com/HoundstoothSTL/topcoat/ "Topcoat"), in conjunction with this theme.

We use this to theme to start off our WordPress site builds.  

This is a work in progress and we're putting it up on github for easier tracking and versioning, feel free to use at your discretion.

### Setup
    `bower install`
    `npm install`
    `grunt scaffold`
    `grunt` -- watch, livereload


### Production Build
    `grunt build`
    `grunt deploy`
